# Todo List Assignment - HELPSTiR Company

## Overview
This is a Todo List application built with React/Next.js. It allows users to create, update, mark as done, and search for tasks. The application also supports SSR (in Next.js) for better performance.

## Features
- **Create Task**: Add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Update Task**: Edit existing tasks.
- **Mark as Done**: Mark tasks as completed.
- **Search Tasks**: Filter tasks using a search bar.
- **Expandable List**: View detailed task information including the last updated timestamp.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication.
- Integrate with a backend API for persistent data storage.
- Add more advanced filtering and sorting options.

## Acknowledgements
- Dummy data is stored in a JSON file for simplicity.
- This project was developed as part of a technical assessment.

## Setup and Running
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the app with:
   - `npm run start`
   
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
